# 🥝 kiwi-mem

**Most AI memory systems are databases. kiwi-mem is a brain.**

## What it does

kiwi-mem gives your AI long-term memory that works like a human brain.

Not just "save chat logs and search them later" — heat controls what the AI recalls proactively: things you do not mention gradually leave everyday injection, things you revisit become stronger, and sleep reorganizes fragments into deeper understanding. Raw records and every memory representation remain preserved.

All of these mechanisms work together as a unified filtering system: **cold memories may become quiet, but automatic maintenance never erases them.** Recall priority can decay while historical evidence does not, without blowing up the context window or burning through your API budget.

Technically, it's a lightweight proxy gateway that sits between you and any LLM, compatible with both OpenAI-format and Anthropic-native providers. Docker one-click deploy, browser-based admin panel.

**Stack**: Python / FastAPI · PostgreSQL + pgvector · Docker · AGPL-3.0-or-later

## Why kiwi-mem exists

Your AI's memories belong to you — not to a platform.

kiwi-mem is built so that anyone can self-host, audit, and migrate their AI's long-term memory. No vendor lock-in, no black-box storage, no dependence on services that might disappear tomorrow.

If an AI remembers you, you should be able to see what it remembers, decide what it keeps, and take it with you when you leave.

## How memory works like a brain

The core of kiwi-mem isn't any single feature — it's multiple mechanisms working in concert to make AI memory behave like human intuition:

### 🔥 Fades and strengthens

Every memory has a "heat" score. Time makes it naturally decay, but if you keep bringing up the same topic, it warms back up. Aging memories may receive shorter derived representations, while the original and every derived version remain in `memory_versions`. Low heat only causes non-destructive archival: the row leaves automatic injection but remains available for historical search and restoration. Hot memories are injected in full, warm ones as summaries, and cold ones stay quiet.

### 🌙 Sleeps and wakes up smarter

Dream simulates how the human brain consolidates memories during sleep. It works in three layers: first archives outdated and duplicate fragments out of normal recall, then merges related fragments into coherent "memory scenes", and finally infers things you never explicitly said but your AI should understand. Archival never physically deletes the source fragments. Consolidated scenes carry vector indexes, so related topics can bring them back into conversation.

### 📅 Recent is vivid, distant is hazy

The calendar system auto-compresses chat history into hierarchical summaries: day → week → month → quarter → year. When injecting into conversation, recent days get full detail, last week gets abbreviated, older periods get high-level overviews. Just like how you recall the past — you know what you ate yesterday, but last month is mostly outlines.

### 🧩 Contradictions update, important things stick

When a new memory conflicts with an old one (you changed jobs, moved cities), the old version leaves default recall while its text and `supersedes` relationship remain historically traceable. Memories you lock by hand are sacred — they never decay, retire, or auto-archive. Machine-locked memories can be demoted after 90 days without recall, but are never deleted.

### ⚡ Budget and context aware

All static content (persona, profile, locked memories, calendar summaries) is ordered first in the prompt to hit cache, dynamic content (search results, drowsiness hints) comes after. This injection order can save up to 90% on API input costs. Combined with calendar compression and heat-tiered injection, even months of memories won't overflow your context window.

### 🔌 Not just OpenAI — direct Anthropic too

Most AI memory solutions only work with OpenAI-format APIs. kiwi-mem also supports Anthropic's native format — if you have an Anthropic API key, you can connect directly without a relay or proxy. Just select "Anthropic native" when adding a provider in the admin panel, and kiwi-mem handles all format differences, including streaming and tool use.

> ⚠️ Anthropic native format must be configured through the admin panel (select "Anthropic native" when adding a provider). Environment variable configuration only works with OpenAI-compatible providers.

### 🧰 Only the tools you need, when you need them

kiwi-mem has 20+ built-in tools (memory search, calendar queries, reminders, web search, etc.). Loading all of them into every conversation wastes hundreds of tokens on tool descriptions the model won't even use.

The Tool Drawer takes a smarter approach: for each message, it quickly figures out which tools you might need and only loads those. The rest stay in the drawer. Like a chef who doesn't put every spice on the counter — just the ones they need right now.

Off by default. Turn it on in the admin panel under Config if you want it.

### 🔒 Projects stay in their lane

If you use the project feature to separate different contexts (work in one project, daily life in another, fiction writing in a third), their memories are now fully isolated. Client info from your work project won't leak into casual conversations, Dream only consolidates fragments within the same project, and daily digests and locked memories follow the same rule.

No setup needed — isolation is automatic.

### 🪞 Multiple doors, one autobiographical self

The standalone `/memory/v1` API, chat gateway, and both MCP transports can be shared by Codex, Claude Code, and future API clients. Each door has a different credential and the server stores SHA-256 digests only. Credentials only record where a request entered. The server assigns one `assistant_identity_id` and one `memory_space_id`, and clients cannot override them. Semantic memories use the assistant's first-person voice; machine provenance remains database audit metadata and is omitted from ordinary archive responses, recalled prose, handoff context, and identity narration.

The same narrative contract covers automatic extraction, daily consolidation, Dream merge/softening, MemScenes, calendar summaries, and the user profile, and is appended after any custom prompt. Automatic extraction reads only the current session, so concurrent windows cannot be spliced into a conversation that never happened. Assistant memories use first person; facts about Zhizhi use “Zhizhi/she.” Invalid generated output is not stored and cannot retire its source memories first.

The first-person contract governs the assistant's internal semantic memories only. Verbatim chat is never rewritten; the archive viewer labels the roles “知知/Lyra” and “凛/Grey.” Caller-supplied conversation and event IDs are mapped to stable opaque identifiers before storage, so archive responses cannot expose room, account, or machine names.

The admin UI and its data-bearing APIs use a separate Bearer secret. The server verifies only its `KIWI_ADMIN_TOKEN_SHA256` digest and the browser keeps the original secret in the current tab. Docker still binds to `127.0.0.1` by default; authentication is a second layer, not a substitute for a private network boundary.

The entire service should still stay on a private network or Tailscale. Authentication narrows access but does not make a verbatim transcript archive suitable for direct public exposure.

## Who is it for

kiwi-mem is designed to **remember a person** — your habits, preferences, emotions, experiences, growth. It's not an enterprise knowledge base, not a document retrieval system, not a knowledge graph.

It works best for:

🏠 **Life assistant** — Remembers your dietary habits, health conditions, schedule preferences. Gets better the longer you use it.

🩶 **Long-term companion** — Emotional support, daily conversation, deep relationships. Your AI actually "knows you" instead of starting fresh every time.

📖 **Creative partner** — Serialized fiction, worldbuilding, roleplay. All settings, plot threads, and character arcs stay in memory.

🎓 **Learning tutor** — Tracks your progress, weak spots, and past questions. Tutoring gets more targeted over time.

---

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose (recommended — includes PostgreSQL + pgvector)
- An LLM API key (OpenRouter / OpenAI / DeepSeek / Anthropic / any compatible provider)

> 💡 Two connection modes: OpenAI-compatible format (most providers) and Anthropic native format (direct API connection, no relay needed). Choose in the admin panel when adding a provider.

> 💡 No Docker? You can deploy manually with Python 3.12+ and your own PostgreSQL (pgvector extension required).

### Three steps

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/LucieEveille/kiwi-mem.git
cd kiwi-mem

# 2. Configure
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API_KEY (other settings have defaults)

# 3. Launch
docker compose up -d
```

Visit `http://localhost:8080` — if you see `{"status":"running"}`, you're good.

### What's next

- Visit `/admin` for the browser-based admin panel; it prompts for the original admin secret whose digest is configured in `KIWI_ADMIN_TOKEN_SHA256`
- Point your chat client's API endpoint to `http://localhost:8080/v1`
- Works with any OpenAI-format frontend: ChatBox, NextChat, SillyTavern, or your own

> 🔐 The shared-identity `/memory/v1/*` API uses per-door Bearer credentials. Admin, debug, Dream, calendar, and sync routes use a separate admin Bearer secret; the server stores SHA-256 digests only. The legacy chat gateway and MCP transport are still not public-Internet authentication boundaries, so keep the entire service on a private network/Tailscale or behind a strict reverse-proxy route allowlist. Once complete transcript archiving is enabled, do not expose the service directly to the public Internet. Docker Compose binds to `127.0.0.1` by default; set `KIWI_BIND_IP` to a private/Tailscale address for cross-host access.

> 💡 80+ parameters can be changed at runtime via the admin panel — no restart needed.

### Importing existing memories

Want to bring in memories from previous AI conversations? Two ways:

**Option 1: Add via admin panel (recommended)**

Open `/admin` → click 🧠 Memories in the sidebar → **+ Add Memory** in the top right → fill in title, content, and importance → Save.

Best for a small number of memories. What you see is what you get.

**Option 2: Bulk import**

Memory import is being rebuilt and will return in a future version in a smarter form.

## Full feature list

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

### 🧠 Memory extraction & retrieval
- **RRF hybrid search**: Vector + keyword search in parallel, Reciprocal Rank Fusion merge
- **Auto-extraction**: Every N turns, extracts key info as memory fragments
- **jieba Chinese segmentation**: Custom domain vocabulary
- **Synonym expansion**: "medication" finds "prescription", "drugs", "medicine"
- **Semantic deduplication**: Similar memories auto-detected

### 🔥 Memory heat system
- Time decay (half-life) · recall heating · query diversity · emotional weight
- Only memories actually injected into the prompt count as recalled; recalled low-resolution memories are extended by 30 days
- Tiered injection (hot → full text / warm → summary / cold → skip)
- Nightly softening appends derived versions with a 21-day cooldown; the original and every earlier version remain immutable
- User locks never retire; auto locks and Dream-promoted locks can retire after 90 days without recall, but are not deleted
- Dream merge outputs keep a default floor of 20 items, and MemScenes can flow back into normal chat by vector similarity

### 🌙 Dream consolidation
- Archive layer (move outdated / duplicate / contradictory fragments out of normal recall without deleting them)
- Consolidation layer (fragments → MemScenes)
- Growth layer (Foresight — infer implications)
- Triggers: manual / drowsiness reminder / auto after 24h inactivity

### 📅 Calendar hierarchy
- Auto-generated day pages · day → week → month → quarter → year compression
- Matryoshka injection (recent = detailed, distant = summarized)
- User profile: four-section structure, updated daily

### ⚡ Smart system prompt injection
- Static zone (persona → profile → locked → calendar) hits cache
- Dynamic zone (search results → drowsiness hint) per-turn
- Auto-handoff context between chat windows
- Template variable support

### 🔌 Multi-provider LLM routing
- Multiple providers, auto-select by model name
- OpenAI-compatible and Anthropic native format support
- One-click provider connection test in admin panel
- Balance queries, model grouping

### 🧰 Tool Drawer
- Vector similarity determines which tools each turn needs
- 20+ internal tools loaded on demand, not all at once
- External MCP servers are best stored in the `mcp_servers` config key; once the drawer is enabled, they become dynamic drawer categories
- `mcp_mode` only controls config-source external drawers: `off` excludes them, `auto` routes by vector/keyword plus pinned IDs, and `manual` keeps only pinned IDs
- Request-body `mcp_servers` remain supported as the backward-compatible path for third-party frontends and are treated as explicit input, so they are not governed by `mcp_mode`
- Off by default, one-click toggle in admin panel

### 🔒 Project memory isolation
- Different projects have fully isolated memories
- Dream, daily digest, and locked memory injection all respect project scope
- No manual config needed — automatic on project creation

### 🔧 Tools & extensions
- MCP Server (20+ tools) + MCP Client
- Web search (7 engines)
- Context compression, file parsing, chain-of-thought display

### 🛡️ Deployment & management
- Web admin panel · cloud sync · backup/restore
- Reminder system · Docker deploy

## FAQ

**Q: Do I need to know how to code?**
A: No. Docker one-click deploy, admin panel for everything. The creator of this project doesn't write code herself.

**Q: Which LLMs are supported?**
A: Two ways to connect. Most providers (OpenRouter, OpenAI, DeepSeek, Ollama, etc.) use OpenAI-compatible format. Anthropic can connect directly via native API — no relay needed. Choose the format when adding a provider in the admin panel.

**Q: Will memories grow forever?**
A: No. The heat system naturally phases out cold memories, Dream consolidates fragments, calendar compression handles long-term content, and injection has a configurable cap. These mechanisms together keep memory size manageable.

**Q: How much does Dream cost?**
A: About $0.005–0.02 per run with Claude Haiku.

**Q: Is this suitable for a work knowledge base?**
A: Not really. kiwi-mem is designed to remember a person — their life, emotions, habits, and experiences — not to store and retrieve document knowledge. If you need enterprise knowledge management or document RAG, there are better-suited tools.

## How this project came to be

kiwi-mem was born from a real need: I wanted my AI to remember me.

Every feature — from memory heat to Dream consolidation, from calendar compression to contradiction detection — came from a real problem encountered in daily use, then designed, built, and refined through conversation. Product direction driven by [Lucie](https://github.com/LucieEveille), code written by [Claude](https://claude.ai) (Anthropic) — a genuine human-AI collaboration from start to finish.
